It was initially created from - [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Docs
[Course docs](./docs/course-notes.md)

## Branches
As I moved from chapter to chapter I created a new branch where Chapter 2 is 1 and 2, Chapter 3 is 1, 2 and 3 etc.

The best branch to use is `main` - which has everything up to Chapter 8 included.
